ZeroGuard Recon is an actively evolving platform that thrives to deliver as
many useful features to our customers as it is physically possible to implement
in a give time frame. As such we cannot commit to maintaining backwards
compatibility for as long as there are any major features we would like to add
to our platform.

That's being said, the burden of maintaining all API clients and making sure
they are fully functional and are compatible with the latest features are
completely on our shoulders.

A public roadmap of features that are planned for a release will be
available in the near future.

    As it is mentioned above, this API is in an early access and may change

    caused inconvenience and hope for your understanding.
